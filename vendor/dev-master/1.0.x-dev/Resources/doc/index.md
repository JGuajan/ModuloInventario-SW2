## Installation

Installation is a quick.

### Download the library using composer

Add Sonatra Ajax in your composer.json:

```js
{
    "require": {
        "sonatra/ajax": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

Or tell composer to download the library by running the command:

```bash
$ php composer.phar require sonatra/ajax:"~1.0"
```

Composer will install the library to your project's `vendor/sonatra` directory.
